                        Janine enjoys reading avidly as well as cooking for her family 
            and students as she learns new recipes and studies new cultures and 
            their flavors. A lover of nature, Janine has been attempting to spend
            more time that she already does exploring and enjoying nature as she 
            goes to parks, beaches and anywhere else she can visit to collect sea 
            shells, inspect the wild life and enjoy the sun. Her children have many 
            fond memories of the nature trail walks during summer that got them out 
            of the house and exploring as they enjoyed nature alongside her as well 
            as visiting local museums to learn more about the local history of Florida 
            as well as the sea life. Janine has never strayed away from experimenting 
            with food and cooking things outside of her usual scope. She also has 
            experimented with food for the sake of education as she once created hardtack 
            authentically in the way that it would have been prepared for military use to 
            show the eating situation during the time. Although this is a less than desirable 
            form of food for the sake of education, Janine also spends her time cooking and 
            prepping much more savory foods than Hardtack for her students as shown by her 
            Greek salad prep image below. With her mother being an avid cook who has always 
            made delicious meals for her and her grandchildren, Janine followed in her 
            footsteps as she creates decadent meals to this day for her family and far beyond.
